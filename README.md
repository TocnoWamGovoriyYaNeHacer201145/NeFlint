# 🔥 Flint

**Flint** is an interpreted programming language implemented in **Java**. It is designed to be simple, expressive, and dynamically typed — making it a great tool for learning language design and implementation or building lightweight scripting capabilities into Java applications.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Single-threaded execution**
- ✅ **Dynamically typed variables**
- ✅ **First-class functions**
- ✅ **Arrays**
- ✅ **Objects**
- ✅ **Interpreted runtime** (no compilation step required)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Flint is built for:
- **Simplicity** – Keep syntax clean and human-friendly.
- **Flexibility** – Use dynamic types to make coding faster and more expressive.
- **Extensibility** – Built in Java for easy integration and future enhancement.

## ✨ Example Code (Coming Soon)

```Flint
// Declare variables
let name = "Flint"
let count = 42

// Define a function
function greet(user) {
  print("Hello, " + user)
}

// Use arrays
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Use objects
let user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
}

greet(user.name)
```
